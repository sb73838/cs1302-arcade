1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code. Read the project description and selected two games after
doing some research. We then created the home page and menu options for the two games. 

2. **TODO:** Start implementing the UI, mechanics, and scoring for game 1.

3. **PROB:** There haven't been many problems so far. The only minor issue has been schedule conflicts
so we have not met as much as we like.
