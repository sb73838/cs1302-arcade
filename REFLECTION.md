1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code. Read the project description and selected two games after
doing some research. We then created the home page and menu options for the two games. 

2. **TODO:** Start implementing the UI, mechanics, and scoring for game 1.

3. **PROB:** There haven't been many problems so far. The only minor issue has been schedule conflicts
so we have not met as much as we like.

1. **DONE:** Started implementing reversi game by adding the board, player, and game classes. Assigned
the black and white pieces to the initial game board with player 1 to black and player 2 to white.
Next, we started working on the home screen for Tetris and added these sections: difficulty levels,
score, and start/reset buttons. Finally, we updated the ArcadeApp class to use the new TetrisScene class.

2. **TODO:** For Tetris, we will be designing the various shapes and their directions at a specified speed.
Other visual elements will be added to make the game appealing. If we get time we will also design the home
screen for Reversi and implement its logic.

3. **PROB:** The only difficulty we had was meeting up because there was thanksgiving break. We were able to
communicate through skype and hope to meet in person more often for next week. In addition, it took a few
trials to develop the layout for Tetris home screen.
