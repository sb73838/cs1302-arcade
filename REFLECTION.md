## TUE 2019-11-19 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code. Read the project description and selected two games after
doing some research. We then created the home page and menu options for the two games. 

2. **TODO:** Start implementing the UI, mechanics, and scoring for game 1.

3. **PROB:** There haven't been many problems so far. The only minor issue has been schedule conflicts
so we have not met as much as we like.

## TUE 2019-11-26 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Started implementing reversi game by adding the board, player, and game classes. Assigned
the black and white pieces to the initial game board with player 1 to black and player 2 to white.
Next, we started working on the home screen for Tetris and added these sections: difficulty levels,
score, and start/reset buttons. Finally, we updated the ArcadeApp class to use the new TetrisScene class.

2. **TODO:** For Tetris, we will be designing the various shapes and their directions at a specified speed.
Other visual elements will be added to make the game appealing. If we get time we will also design the home
screen for Reversi and implement its logic.

3. **PROB:** The only difficulty we had was meeting up because there was thanksgiving break. We were able to
communicate through skype and hope to meet in person more often for next week. In addition, it took a few
trials to develop the layout for Tetris home screen.

1. **DONE:** Finished most of the development for Tetris. As part of Tetris, we created TetrisShape,
TetrisBoard, Point and TetrisScene classes. The css styling was put in a separate file application.css under
resources. The game supports different levels as the user keeps making progress. All the keystrokes have
been made to work accordingly and a pause button stops the game at its current state. We also created the base
game board for the reversi game as well as the player pieces, using a separate ReversiScene class.

2. **TODO:** For Tetris, we will finish adding the instructions guide under a help button. We also plan to add
a highscore table as part of the extra credit. Now we will focus on developing the game rules for Reversi.
Last, we plan to add an animated intro to our arcade app as part of the second extra credit opportunity.

3. **PROB:** There were not any difficulties this week. We were able to meet up at Boyd and work on Tetris for
the logic of the game and the main board for Reversi. We plan to meet up a few more times in the upcoming week and finish
implementing Reversi.
